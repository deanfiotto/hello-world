# hello-world
This is my first assignment for the Coding the Law course. 

Hello everyone! 
Especially Pat. :)

I'm a 3L at Suffolk Law. I work in-house at what is at heart a tech startup. Accordingly, I am excited to explore and learn about the complex tech side of the business. I like tacos, sports, and videogames.
